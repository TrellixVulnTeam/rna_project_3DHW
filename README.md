# miRSeedBase: miRNA seed-based online tool

miRSeedBase offers IR from a seed-based database, mapping of evolutionary events in miRNA families and provides both
visual outputs and raw data, achieved by using a two-way mapping we created between a seed sequence and a family name.

## Background information

miRNAs regulate the gene expression by binding to the mRNA, with the seed sequence being an essential part of the process.
The seed sequence is a conserved heptametrical sequence which is mostly situated at positions 2-7 from the miRNA 5Â´-end.
Even though base pairing of miRNA and its target mRNA does not match perfectly, the seed sequence has to be perfectly complementary.
The miRNA can be divided into families based on their seed sequences. Family analysis done in previous studies showed that
there are miRNA with the same seed in many organisms.

## Built With

* mirbase.org, Version 22.0, database files
* jsphylosvg.com to - used to render the graph reports
* phyloXML converter by Christian Zmasek - used to convert various phylogentic tree formats to phyloXML.
